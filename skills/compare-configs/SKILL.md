Help me compare experiment configurations:

1. Ask me which two branches/commits to compare
2. Show differences in:
   - manifest.yaml
   - Key config files (*.yaml, *.json in configs/)
   - Python files with hyperparameters

3. Highlight:
   - Changed hyperparameters
   - Different entrypoints or commands
   - Modified dependencies or resources

4. Summarize the key differences that would affect experiment results

Present findings in a clear, structured format.
